## Libraries

* [Python, Textlytics](https://github.com/laugustyniak/textlytics) - set of 
sentiment analysis examples based on Amazon Data, SemEval, IMDB etc.

* [Polish Sentiment Model](https://github.com/riomus/polish-sentiment) - 
Sentiment analysis for polish language using SVM and BoW - within Docker.

ground up in carefully memory-managed Cython. Independent research has 
confirmed that spaCy is the fastest in the world. If your application needs 
to process entire web dumps, spaCy is the library you want to be using.
